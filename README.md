## Live Demo

## Future Scope

This project is currently implemented using the mock data provided by Valtech, which can be found in [the Valtech GitHub Repository](https://github.com/valtech-fr).

To enhance the app and make it more appealing, real images of the company, office locations, and other relevant content can be integrated using real-time data. This will provide users with a more authentic experience and allow for dynamic updates to the displayed information.
